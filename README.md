# Playground
The purpose of this repository is to store all of my experimental code snippets.

I like exploring what's possible to create in various programming languages.
Besides that, it's just fun like that.

If you're reading this, be aware that there might be some errors in the code, I apologize.
The entirety of this repository is pointless out of storing my experiments and sharing my skills.

Thank you!
